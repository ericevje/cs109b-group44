    "### Simulating manufacturing processes in design\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 umbrellas of manufacturing for manufactured parts, additive manufacturing and subtractive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing, such as injection molding and 3D printing, *add* material to create a solid object. Opposite of this is machining, which starts with a block of materials and *subtracts* material to create the final design. Additive manufacturing is like working with clay, whereas subtractive manufacturing is like working with a granite block and chisel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Good design practices recommend designing your part in the way that it will be manufactured. If a part is to be manufactured via a subtractive manufacturing process, it is best practice to start your model as a block of material and cut away material. This allows the designer to visualize and optimize the design for the manufcaturing process and allows for easier editing of the design later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "The search feature implemented in the $Search$ class and its children start with a blank graph and *add* bodies to form the design. Though its possible for the agent to choose to extrude a bounding box then cut away to the target, it is not guaranteed, and typically not what happens. Further, due to the limitations imposed by the message passing network, namely the fact it returns 2 faces and an operation, as well the rules imposed on the agent (namely the faces must be parallel) there are several more complex shapes that it completely fails at making. Essentially, if there is a face with no parallel faces it canot be created. See examples below of a shape the agent fails to reconstruct. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p float=\"center\"> \n",
    "  <img src=\"images/77211_d46ae17d_0013.png\" style=\"height:300px\"/> \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> Pyramidal face with no parallel faces fails to be reconstructed </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking into the ground truth of the above model, it is apparent that the final model was formed from a bounding box, then two extrude cut operations were used to complete the shape. Since the final cuts go all the way through the model, there are no parallel faces for the agent to complete a face extrusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p float=\"center\"> \n",

    "<center> Extrusion steps to recreate the solid object </center>\n",

    "This particular model fails the search algorithm due to the parallel face limitation of face extrusions. If we were able to start with the bounding box and cut away to reveal the model, however, this could be reconstructed using the existing framework of the search algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, we needed to modify the search algorithm to add a bounding box before each face extrusion operation. The code below was added to the $search\\_best$ script used to search and update action probabilities based on the step or steps with best $IoU$. \n",

Unfortunately, the agent is not able to use the faces of the bounding box to create extrude cuts, so the best we were able to do was an exact negative of the object. The tables above show the maximum `IoU` achieved for the `bounded=True` group was 0.943, so no exact reconstructions were created. Further the mean `IoU` was only $0.29$ as compared to $0.88$ for the original implementation.\n",
